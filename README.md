# BMI Calculator :computer:
- Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. üò® BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
- With this BMI Calculator, you can calculate and evaluate your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the relevant information on body weight, height, age. Check your body stats to find your ideal weight, because overweight and obesity are risk factors for diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
